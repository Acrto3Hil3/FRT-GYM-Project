# ‚ö†Ô∏è ### *Note: This portfolio made for the purpose of FRT Project submition. So, I am not providing any services related to web or designs.

# Skills Require :
1.HTML : HTML is first step to create any web project.

2.CSS : CSS is use to design the page.

# How to use :

### Follow the steps give below :

 1.Clone the Repository : git clone https://github.com/Acrto3Hil3/FRT-GYM-Project.git

 2.Then simply open it with live server or run on localhost.

# GitHub Pages:
GitHub Pages is a free web hosting service provided by GitHub that allows you to publish static websites directly from your GitHub repositories. It is designed to host documentation, personal portfolios, project landing pages, blogs, and other static content.

# Deploying a project on GitHub Pages:
1.Create a GitHub Repository: If you haven't already, create a new repository on GitHub to host your project. You can also use an existing repository if you prefer.

2.Push Project Files to the Repository: Upload all the files and folders of your project to the GitHub repository using Git. You can use the following commands in your terminal:

git init git add . git commit -m "Initial commit" git remote add origin git push -u origin master

Replace with the URL of your GitHub repository.

3.Branching (Optional): If your project uses a different branch (e.g., main or development) instead of master, make sure to push your code to the appropriate branch.

4.Configure GitHub Pages: Go to your repository on GitHub and navigate to the "Settings" tab. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section. Under "Source," select the branch you want to use for GitHub Pages (e.g., gh-pages or master), and save your changes.

5.Wait for Deployment: GitHub Pages will automatically build and deploy your project based on the selected branch. It might take a few moments for the deployment to complete.

6.Access Your Deployed Project: Once the deployment is successful, you can access your deployed project at the following URL: https://.github.io/

Replace with your GitHub username and with the name of your repository.

Please note that for certain projects (e.g., React apps created using create-react-app), you might need to configure additional settings to ensure proper deployment.

# Azure Portal :
Azure Portal is a web-based, unified management console provided by Microsoft for managing and monitoring resources and services in the Microsoft Azure cloud platform. It serves as a central hub where users can access, configure, and monitor various Azure services and resources.

 *Note: We use Azure Static web app to host this portfolio webpage.

# How to use Azure Static Web App :
To deploy a project on Azure Static Web Apps using Git, follow these steps:

1.Create a GitHub Repository: Ensure your project is hosted in a GitHub repository. If you don't have one, create a new repository and push your project code to it.

2.Azure Portal Sign-In: Sign in to the Azure Portal at https://portal.azure.com using your Azure account.

3.Create a Static Web App: In the Azure Portal, click on "+ Create a resource" and search for "Static Web Apps." Select "Static Web Apps" from the list and click "Create."

4.Configure Static Web App: Fill out the necessary details, such as the subscription, resource group, and static web app name. Choose the GitHub repository and branch that you want to deploy.

5.Build Configuration: Set the build configuration for your project. This includes specifying the build preset (e.g., "Angular," "React," "Vue.js," or "Hugo") and the build command, if required.

6.Review and Create: Review your configuration settings, and if everything looks good, click "Create" to create the static web app.

7.Wait for Deployment: Azure will automatically build and deploy your static web app from the selected GitHub repository. The deployment process may take a few minutes.

8.Access Your Static Web App: Once the deployment is complete, you can access your static web app using the URL provided in the Azure Portal.

9.Continuous Deployment: Any changes you push to the selected branch in your GitHub repository will trigger automatic deployments to Azure Static Web Apps. This enables continuous deployment for your static web app.

That's it! Your project is now deployed on Azure Static Web Apps and is accessible via the provided URL.
